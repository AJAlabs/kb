AJAlabs Knowledge Base
==================================================

I am no literary genius, and this is my first attempt at publishing technical documentation, let alone publishing anything for that matter. Most of my technical documentation has been written in what I like to call my personal knowledge base, which is either within Evernote or jotted down on one of many small Moleskine notebooks. Some networking professionals call it an "engineering journal". Regardless of what you call it, I believe every IT Professional should have their own knowledge base to reference now and again. This is my attempt at sharing some of the information I reference almost daily, and hopefully someone will find it helpful as much as I do.

With that being said, the brevity of each topic is intentional, as the AJAlabs Knowledge Base is not a comprehensive how-to guide or instructional by any means. The information, command syntax and methodologies contained in the AJAlabs Knowledge Base is intended to be a quick reference or as a reminder for something I may have forgotten.

For a more comprehensive and exhaustive overview of certain topics, I have included an Additional Resources section at the end of each topic, where you will find recommendations for books, articles, tools and additional documentation.

*"I have long been a fan of what I call the “engineering journal,” a small notebook that can be carried around and that contains little nuggets of information—commands that you forget, the IP addressing scheme of some remote part of the network, little reminders about how to do something you only have to do once or twice a year (but is vital to the integrity and maintenance of your network)."*
